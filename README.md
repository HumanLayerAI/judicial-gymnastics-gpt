## What It Does

A custom ChatGPT GPT that analyzes judicial opinions and exposes the rhetorical moves judges use to reach predetermined conclusions. The system identifies logical fallacies, circular reasoning, selective citation, and other forms of "judicial gymnastics" that undermine the appearance of principled legal reasoning.

Rather than treating court opinions as authoritative statements of law, the GPT treats them as persuasive documents subject to critical analysis.

## Why I Made This

Legal education often teaches deference to judicial authority without developing critical reading skills for identifying when judges are reasoning backwards from conclusions. This creates lawyers who can cite precedent but cannot identify when precedent is being manipulated.

This GPT exists to demonstrate how **critical legal analysis** can be systematized—helping law students, practitioners, and researchers develop a more skeptical, analytically rigorous approach to reading judicial opinions.
